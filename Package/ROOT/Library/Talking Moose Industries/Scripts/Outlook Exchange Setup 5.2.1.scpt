This file is one of four files for assisting a user with configuring
an Exchange account in Microsoft Outlook 2016 for Mac:

1. Outlook Exchange Setup 5.2.1.scpt
2. OutlookExchangeSetupLaunchAgent.sh
3. net.talkingmoose.OutlookExchangeSetupLaunchAgent.plist
4. com.microsoft.Outlook.plist for creating a configuraiton profile

These scripts and files may be freely modified for personal or commercial
purposes but may not be republished for profit without prior consent.

If you find these resources useful or have ideas for improving them,
please let me know. It is only compatible with Outlook 2016 for Mac.

--------------------------------------------

This script assists a user with the setup of his Exchange account
information. Below are basic instructions for using the script.
Consult the Outlook Exchange Setup 5 Administrator's Guide
for complete details.

1.	Customize the "network and  server properties" below with information
	appropriate to your network.
	
2.	Deploy this script to a location on your Macs such as
	"/Library/CompanyName/OutlookExchangeSetup5.2.1.scpt".

3. 	Deploy the recommended "Outlook preferences.mobileconfig"
	configuration profile to eliminate Outlook's startup windows.
	This assumes you're using the volume license edition
	of Office 2016 for Mac.
	
4.	Deploy the OutlookExchangeSetup5.plist file to
	/Library/LaunchAgents. Update the path to point to the
	OutlookExchangeSetup5.2.1.scpt script.
	  
This script assumes the user's full name is in the form of "Last, First",
but is easily modified if the full name is in the form of "First Last".
It works especially well if the Mac is bound to Active Directory where
the user's short name will match his login name. Optionally, you cans set dscl
to pull the user's EMailAddress from a directory service.

--------------------------------------------
-- Begin network, server and preferences
--------------------------------------------


--------------- Exchange Server settings ----------------------

property useKerberos : true
-- Set this to true only if Macs in your environment are bound
-- to Active Directory and your network is properly configured.

property ExchangeServer : "exchange.example.com"
-- Address of your organization's Exchange server.

property ExchangeServerRequiresSSL : true
-- True for most servers.

property ExchangeServerSSLPort : 443
-- If ExchangeServerRequiresSSL is true set the port to 443.
-- If ExchangeServerRequiresSSL is false set the port to 80.
-- Use a different port number only if your administrator instructs you.

property DirectoryServer : "gc.example.com"
-- Address of an internal Global Catalog server (a type of Windows domain controller).
-- The LDAP server in a Windows network will be a Global Catalog server,
-- which is separate from the Exchange Server.

property DirectoryServerRequiresAuthentication : true
-- This will almost always be true.

property DirectoryServerRequiresSSL : true
-- This will almost always be true.

property DirectoryServerSSLPort : 3269
-- If DirectoryServerRequiresSSL is true set the port to 3269.
-- If DirectoryServerRequiresSSL is false set the port to 3268.
-- Use a different port number only if your Exchange administrator instructs you.

property DirectoryServerMaximumResults : 1000
-- When searching the Global Catalog server, this number determines
-- the maximum number of entries to display.

property DirectoryServerSearchBase : ""
-- example: "cn=users,dc=domain,dc=com"
-- Usually, this is empty.


--------------- For Active Directory users ---------------------

property getUserInformationFromActiveDirectory : true
-- If Macs are bound to Active Directory they can probably use
-- dscl to return the current user's email address, phone number, title, etc.
-- Use Active Directory when possible, otherwise complete the next section.


--------------- For non Active Directory users ---------------

property domainName : "example.com"
-- Complete this only if not using Active Directory to get user information.
-- The part of your organization's email address following the @ symbol.

property emailFormat : 1
-- Complete this only if not using Active Directory to get user information.
-- When Active Directory is unavailable to determine a user's email address,
-- this script will attempt to parse it from the display name of the user's login.

-- Describe your organization's email format:
-- 1: Email format is first.last@domain.com
-- 2: Email format is first@domain.com
-- 3: Email format is flast@domain.com (first name initial plus last name)
-- 4: Email format is shortName@domain.com

property displayName : 2
-- Complete this only if not using Active Directory to get user information.
-- Describe how the user's display name appears at the bottom of the menu
-- when clicking the Apple menu (Log Out Joe Cool... or Log Out Cool, Joe...).
-- 1: Display name appears as "Last, First"
-- 2: Display name appears as "First Last"

property domainPrefix : ""
-- Optionally append a NetBIOS domain name to the beginning of the user's short name.
-- Be sure to use two backslashes when adding a name.
-- Example: Use "TALKINGMOOSE\\" to set user name "TALKINGMOOSE\username".


--------------- User Experience -------------------------------

property verifyEMailAddress : false
-- If set to "true", a dialog asks the user to confirm his email address.

property verifyServerAddress : false
-- If set to "true", a dialog asks the user to confirm his Exchange server address.

property displayDomainPrefix : false
-- If set to "true", the username appears as "DOMAIN\username".
-- Otherwise, the username appears as "username".

property downloadHeadersOnly : false
-- If set to "true", only email headers are downloaded into Outlook.
-- This takes much less time to sync but a user must be online
-- to download and view messages.

property hideOnMyComputerFolders : false
-- If set to "true", hides local folders.
-- A single Exchange account should do this by default.

property unifiedInbox : false
-- If set to "true", turns on the Group Similar Folders feature
-- in Outlook menu > Preferences > General.

property disableAutodiscover : false
-- If set to "true", disables Autodiscover functionality
-- for the Exchange account. Not recommended for mobile devices
-- that may connect to an internal Exchange server address and
-- connect to a different external Exchange server address.

property errorMessage : "Outlook's setup for your Exchange account failed. Please contact the Help Desk for assistance."
-- Customize this error message for your users in case their account setup fails
